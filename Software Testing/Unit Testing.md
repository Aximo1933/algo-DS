# Unit Testing

Unit testing is a testing technique where individual modules are tested to determine if there are any issues. This testing is performed by the developer to ensure the functional correctness of standalone modules. The primary objective is to isolate each unit of the system, identify, analyze, and fix defects.

## Unit Testing - Advantages

- Reduces defects in newly developed features and reduces bugs when changing existing functionality.
- Reduces the cost of testing as defects are captured in the very early phase.
- Improves the design and allows for better refactoring of the code.
- Unit tests, when integrated with the build process, help ensure the quality of the build.
