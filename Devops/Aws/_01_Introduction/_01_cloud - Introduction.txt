what is cloud ?

simplay way to put it,

"Think of having an incredibly strong computer at your place. It can do many cool things, 
 but it does have limits. Like, if you gather lots of pictures, videos, or important files, 
 it might run out of room."

Now, the cloud is like a magic storage on the internet. Instead of cramming everything into 
your computer, you keep it in this online storage. Imagine a virtual backpack that you can open 
from anywhere, as long as you're online.

But wait, the cloud is more than storage. It's like having access to super powerful computers 
that work super fast. So, if you have a big task, like fixing a video or doing a huge project, 
you can send it to these powerful computers in the cloud, and they handle it.

The coolest part? You don't need to fuss over the techie things, like how these computers run or 
where they sit. The cloud handles all that. You can just focus on using your virtual backpack and
these strong computers to get things done, no matter where or what device you're on."

"Cloud computing is a model for delivering various computing services over the internet. 
Instead of owning and maintaining physical hardware and software on your own, you can rent 
access to resources provided by a cloud service provider. These resources include computing 
power, storage, databases, networking, software, and more

There are a few key components that make up cloud computing:

    Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): 
        This is like renting the basic building blocks of computing, 
        such as virtual machines, storage, and networking. You get the flexibility to set up and configure 
        these resources according to your needs, much like having a virtual data center.

    Platform as a Service (PaaS): 
        With PaaS, you're provided with a more managed environment. 
        You can focus on developing and deploying your applications without worrying about the underlying 
        infrastructure. 
        The platform handles things like runtime, operating system, and middleware.

    Software as a Service (SaaS): 
        This is the most user-friendly layer. SaaS delivers fully functional software applications over the internet. 
        You don't need to install or maintain anything – you just use the software as is. 
        Examples include Google Workspace (formerly G Suite), Microsoft 365, and cloud-based CRM systems.

What is Cloud Computing?
    • Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage,
    applications, and other IT resources
    • Through a cloud services platform with pay-as-you-go pricing
    • You can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you
    need
    • You can access as many resources as you need, almost instantly
    • Simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a set of application services
    • Amazon Web Services owns and maintains the network-connected hardware
    required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need
    via a web application

The Deployment Models of the Cloud
    
    Private Cloud:
    • Cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to the public.
    • Complete control
    • Security for sensitive applications
    • Meet specific business needs
    ---
    Public Cloud:
    • Cloud resources owned and operated by a thirdparty cloud service provider delivered overthe Internet.
    • Six Advantages of Cloud Computing
    ---
    Hybrid Cloud:
    • Keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the Cloud
    • Control over sensitive assets in your private infrastructure
    • Flexibility and costeffectiveness of the public cloud

Six Advantages of Cloud Computing

    • Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)
        • Pay On-Demand: don’t own hardware
        • Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX)
    • Benefit from massive economies of scale
        • Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
    • Stop guessing capacity
        • Scale based on actual measured usage
    • Increase speed and agility
    • Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
    • Go global in minutes: leverage the AWS global infrastructure

Problems solved by the Cloud

    • Flexibility: change resource types when needed
    • Cost-Effectiveness: pay as you go, for what you use
    • Scalability: accommodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or adding additional nodes
    • Elasticity: ability to scale out and scale-in when needed
    • High-availability and fault-tolerance: build across data centers
    • Agility: rapidly develop, test and launch software applications

Types of Cloud Computing
    • Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
        • Provide building blocks for cloud IT
        • Provides networking, computers, data storage space
        • Highest level of flexibility
        • Easy parallel with traditional on-premises IT
    • Platform as a Service (PaaS)
        • Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure
        • Focus on the deployment and management of your applications
    • Software as a Service (SaaS)
        • Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider
