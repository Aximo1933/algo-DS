*   Volunteered data - This is created and explicitly shared by individuals, such as social network profiles. This type of data might include video
    files, pictures, text, or audio files.
*   Observed data - This is captured by recording the actions of individuals, such as location data when using cell phones.
*   Inferred data - This is data such as a credit score, which is based on analysis of volunteered or observed data.

# The term bit is an abbreviation of “binary digit” and represents the smallest piece of data. Each bit can only have one of two possible values, 0 or 1.

There are three common methods of signal transmission used in networks:

*    Electrical signals - Transmission is achieved by representing data as electrical pulses on copper wire.
*    Optical signals - Transmission is achieved by converting the electrical signals into light pulses.
*    Wireless signals - Transmission is achieved by using infrared, microwave, or radio waves through the air.
