Bandwidth is the capacity of a medium to carry data. Digital bandwidth measures the amount of data that can flow from one place to another in a given amount of time. Bandwidth is typically measured in the number of bits that (theoretically) can be sent across the media in a second. Common bandwidth measurements are as follows:

* Thousands of bits per second (Kbps)
* Millions of bits per second (Mbps)
* Billions of bits per second (Gbps)

Throughput does not usually match the specified bandwidth. Many factors influence throughput including:

* The amount of data being sent and received over the connection
* The latency created by the number of network devices encountered between source and destination

Latency refers to the amount of time, including delays, for data to travel from one given point to another.
