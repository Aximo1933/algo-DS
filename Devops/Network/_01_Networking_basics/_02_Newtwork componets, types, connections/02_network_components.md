There are symbols that represent various types of networking equipment. The network infrastructure is the platform that supports the network. It provides the stable and reliable channel over which our communications can occur. The network infrastructure contains three categories of hardware components: end devices, intermediate devices, and network media. Hardware is often the visible components of the network platform such as a laptop, PC, switch, router, wireless access point, or the cabling used to connect the devices. Components that are not visible include wireless media.

End devices, or hosts, form the interface between users and the underlying communication network. Some examples of end devices include:

*   Computers (workstations, laptops, file servers, web servers)
*   Network printers
*   Telephones and teleconferencing equipment
*   Security cameras
*   Mobile devices (such as smartphones, tablets, PDAs, and wireless debit/credit card readers and barcode scanners)
