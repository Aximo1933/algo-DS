# What is Helm Chart?

* let's take a step back and talk about doker container
  * Docker help us to package (or containarize ) any app weather it is **Python**, **Java**, **Go** and ship it 
  * Same container can be used for deployment. 
  ```
  Scanario: 
  If we are applying one docker file we can it can serve on or few requestes
  If we need to serve millions of requestes, we need some underline 
  framework to manage container(or we can say our app)
  K8s is such framework which helps us to manage containers
  it will take care of loadbalancing, auto-scaling, auto-deployment, auto-helaing
  ```
    ### Then why we required Helm ?
  * Managing k8s is not an easy task 
  * We need some abstract framework that can sit on top of k8 cluster and with minimal effort we can manage k8
    * For this we have **HELM CHART**   
      * It provide us top layer abstraction to run minimum helm commands which can interact and commumicate with k8 app produce same result effectively
      



## Why we need K8S Kubernetes ?
* How k8s will helm you with docker containers ?
  * *scalability* : you cannot scale single docker container to serve millions of requests
  * *Automate Docker Deployment* : k8s can help to manage automate docker deployment
  * *Auto Healing* : If a container is not healthy then k8scan auto replace the container
  * *Roll-out and Roll-back* : K8s montiors the unhealthy docker containers and restart unresponsive one

## How Helm Chart will Help up to manage k8?
* Helm charts simplify Kubernetes management by packaging applications and their configurations into versioned, customizable templates. 
* They manage dependencies, enable consistent deployments across environments, and offer release lifecycle control, making it easier to collaborate, share, and ensure best practices. 
* This streamlines application deployment and reduces operational complexity in Kubernetes environments.

Package and Deployment Management:
    Application Packaging: Helm charts package your entire Kubernetes application, including all its resources (e.g., deployments, services, config maps, secrets), into a single, versioned package. This packaging simplifies the distribution and deployment of applications on Kubernetes.
    Consistent Deployments: Helm ensures that deployments are consistent across environments. With Helm, you can define your application's structure and configuration once and deploy it consistently to various Kubernetes clusters.
Templating and Customization:
    Configuration Templating: Helm uses templates (Go templates) to parameterize configuration values, making it easy to customize deployments for different environments or use cases. You can create templates for various settings and supply different values per environment, avoiding manual configuration changes.
    Reusability: By creating reusable charts, you can share common application components and configurations with your team or the community. This promotes consistency and reduces duplication of effort.
Dependency Management:
    Dependency Resolution: Helm charts can specify dependencies on other charts. When you install a chart, Helm automatically fetches and installs the required dependencies. This simplifies the management of applications that rely on common components or services.
    Version Control: Helm ensures that you get the correct version of dependencies by maintaining version information in the chart. This helps in maintaining compatibility with your application.
Release Lifecycle Management:
    Deployment Lifecycle: Helm provides commands for deploying, upgrading, and rolling back releases. You can easily update configurations and resource definitions in a chart and apply these changes consistently across different environments.
    Rollback: If issues arise during an upgrade, Helm allows you to roll back to a previous known-good state of the application.
Collaboration and Sharing:
    Community Contributions: Helm charts are often shared within the Kubernetes community, allowing you to leverage pre-built, well-maintained charts for various applications and services. This fosters collaboration and accelerates application development.
    Custom Charts: You can create your own Helm charts and share them with your team or the community, allowing others to use your application configurations and components easily.
Security and Best Practices:
    Secret Management: Helm supports secure handling of sensitive information like passwords and tokens through built-in mechanisms like Helm secrets or external secret management tools.
    Security Scanning: Helm charts can be scanned for vulnerabilities, ensuring that you deploy secure applications.
